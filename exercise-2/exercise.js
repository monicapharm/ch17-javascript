/** Arrays **/

//Create an array `numbers` that contains the first 5 decimals of Pi
//(e.g., 1 4 1 5 9).
//Log out the array.


//Use bracket notation to change the `4` in the array to a `4.2`.
//Log out the updated array.


//Add the number 2 to the end of the array.
//Log out the updated array


//Use the splice() method to add the number 7 between the 5 and the 9.
//See https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp.
//Log out the updated array.


//Log out the length of the array. Use the .length property


//Use bracket notation to add the number 100 at an index equal to the
//length of the array + 1.
//Log out the array as well as its length. What happened?



/** Objects **/

//Create a variable `rect` that represents a rectangle. This should be an Object
//with properties:
//  `x` (coordinate) of 30, `y` of 50, `width` of 100, `height` of 50
//Log out the rectangle.


//Log out the x- and y- coordinates of the rectangle (its location). Your output 
//should have the format `"X, Y"`.


//Set the rectangle's height to be the square root of its width. Use Math.sqrt()
//Use *dot notation* to access the properties!


//Log out the rectangle's area. Use *dot notation* to access the properties!


//Create a variable `circle` that represents a circle. This should be an object
//with properties
//  `cx` (center-x-coordinate), `cy`, and `radius`
//assigned the first 3 numbers from the above array (respectively)
//Log out the circle


//Create an array `shapes` that represents a list of shapes. The array should
//contain the rectangle and the circle objects defined above.
//Log out the variable. Be sure to inspect it in the developer console!


//Add a new ANONYMOUS object to the `shapes` array representing a triangle.
//The triangle should have a base of `33` and a `height` of `44`.
//Log out the shapes array


//Log out the triangle's `hypotenuse` property. What do you get?


//Assign the triangle inside the `shapes` array a 'hypotenuse' property of 55
//Log out the `shapes` array again.
//Check: what happens if you inspect the previously logged array in the Chrome
//developer console?
